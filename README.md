[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peterwilli/IOTA-tangle-explorer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peterwilli/IOTA-tangle-explorer) | [Donate to developer](https://iota.codebuffet.co/#/addr/LAIIZHTEPOTNLZPAEFFZZGPSC9LQZVLDWZAASJZYYIIWRNWJSPXIGZTRESAAMM9QFTVFY9NTLRIWSMHM9CAGASCSYZ) | [Live demo](https://iota.codebuffet.co)

## Introduction

This is a complete recode of the Tangle Explorer, with the following differences on <https://github.com/utamaro/tangler>:

- Completely static, only uses a IOTA node and no extra server for rendering the pages.
- Realtime, automatic updates
- Written in VueJS (React but much simpler)

## How to run

Commands are `displayed like this!`

Assuming you have NodeJS.

- `cd` to tangle-explorer-web
- if you haven't got Yarn yet, run `npm install -g yarn` (possibly as root)
- run `yarn`
- run `yarn dev` and a web browser will pop up with the page.
